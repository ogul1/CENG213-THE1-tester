# CENG213-THE1-tester
Tester for the first Programming assignment of the CENG213 Data Structures course.

Before you start, fill in the corresponding .cpp files in the tester folder and unzip all the zip files.

You can use the ```playground.cpp``` file to test your implementations with small inputs and track your allocations easily.

```g++ -std=c++17 playground.cpp``` to run the file.

```g++ btester.cpp && ./a.out``` for browser tests.

```g++ wtester.cpp && ./a.out``` for window tests.

NOTE: If you are a MacOSX user, check out my comments inside the ```btester.cpp``` and ```wtester.cpp``` files.
